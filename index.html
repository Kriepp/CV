      <h2>Hello</h2>
      <p>
        and thank you for joining me on this exciting journey! I'm Claudiu Satmar, a dedicated physical therapist with a
        passion
        for helping others regain mobility and improve their quality of life. While my journey began in the world of
        healthcare,
        I've discovered a newfound passion for technology and web development.

      <h2>A journey of exploration and discovery</h2>
      <p>
        While my journey began in the field of physical therapy, I've always been drawn to the transformative power of
        technology. Intrigued by its potential to revolutionize healthcare and improve patient outcomes, I embarked on a
        journey
        of exploration and discovery. Along the way, I've discovered a newfound passion for web development—a field that
        allows
        me to blend my expertise in healthcare with my fascination for technology.
