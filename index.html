      <h2>Hi</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Claudiu, a passionate and aspiring JavaScript developer. I specialize in creating dynamic and responsive web
        applications that bring ideas to life. My journey in web development began with a curiosity for coding and has
        grown
        into a dedicated pursuit of excellence in the field.

        On this site, you'll find examples of my work, details about my skills, and a little bit about who I am. I'm
        constantly
        learning and adapting to new technologies, and I thrive on solving complex problems with creative solutions.

        Feel free to explore my projects, learn more about my background, and get in touch if you think we could create
        something amazing together!
      </p>

            <a href="https://jeronimoar.github.io/Dicey-Dinamics/">I had the privilege of collaborating with four
              talented trainees during the
              Kreativstorm training
              program to develop a
              web application. Within this project, I took ownership of creating both the About page and the website's
              footer,
              leveraging HTML and CSS exclusively for their design and implementation.</a>

              Still collaborating with the trainees from Kreativstorm training program we developed a calculator using
              mainly Javascript.
              Within this project, I took ownership of enabling the calculator to accept integers and floats into the
              calculation.

              In colaboration with the team from Kreativstorm training program we developed a rock-paper-scissors game
              using mainly
              alerts in Javascript. In this project I did the testing for the game so we don't encounter any errors and
              the game behaves
              correctly. After the tests were done I talked to the team what can we improve.

              In collaboration with the team from Kreativstorm training program we developed a jumping game using
              mainly Javascript, HTML and CSS.
              In this project I did the gameover logic and the option to replay the game or exit it if the player
              wished.
