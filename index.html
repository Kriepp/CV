      <h2>Hello</h2>
      <p>
        and thank you for joining me on this exciting journey! I'm Claudiu Satmar, a dedicated physical therapist with a
        passion
        for helping others regain mobility and improve their quality of life. While my journey began in the world of
        healthcare,
        I've discovered a newfound passion for technology and web development.

      <h2>A journey of exploration and discovery</h2>
      <p>
        While my journey began in the field of physical therapy, I've always been drawn to the transformative power of
        technology. Intrigued by its potential to revolutionize healthcare and improve patient outcomes, I embarked on a
        journey
        of exploration and discovery. Along the way, I've discovered a newfound passion for web development—a field that
        allows
        me to blend my expertise in healthcare with my fascination for technology.

            <a href="https://jeronimoar.github.io/Dicey-Dinamics/">I had the privilege of collaborating with four
              talented trainees during the
              Kreativstorm training
              program to develop a
              web application. Within this project, I took ownership of creating both the About page and the website's
              footer,
              leveraging HTML and CSS exclusively for their design and implementation.</a>

              Still collaborating with the trainees from Kreativstorm training program we developed a calculator using
              mainly Javascript.
              Within this project, I took ownership of enabling the calculator to accept integers and floats into the
              calculation.

              In colaboration with the team from Kreativstorm training program we developed a rock-paper-scissors game
              using mainly
              alerts in Javascript. In this project I did the testing for the game so we don't encounter any errors and
              the game behaves
              correctly. After the tests were done I talked to the team what can we improve.

              In collaboration with the team from Kreativstorm training program we developed a jumping game using
              mainly Javascript, HTML and CSS.
              In this project I did the gameover logic and the option to replay the game or exit it if the player
              wished.
